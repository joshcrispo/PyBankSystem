# PyBankSystem
Here is a project I created during my second year in college. This project gave me a better understanding in OOP concepts. I am really proud of this project as it allowed me to use file I/O python commands and it showcases my way of working, the inclusion of docstrings and comments makes the code readable for everyone.

Text files used as database for bank system, seperator is used with splitting character '|'.

customer.txt - holds customer details  (login and pass)
